# Hashtime

Hashtime is a general purpose format for blocks over arbitrary
events. All blocks contain hash function based proof of work. Every event has a
set of blocks that point back to the event. The total amount of work on top of an event
can be seen as the age of that event, and the total set of blocks constitute a
"time" system implemented with hash functions.

The name "hash time" denotes that time, in a certain sense, is implemented
using hash functions. The connection between hash time and physical time is
discussed in LINK.

## Relationship to crypto coins and block chains

Hashtime is clearly related to, and inspired by, crypto coins and block chains.
Hashtime was developed as a result of attempting to answer the question of
whether crypto coins, such as bitcoin, have "intrinsic" value.

Like crypto coins, hashtime has blocks, miners, proof of work, and an
economic incentive for miners to compute hash functions. Furthermore, blocks
have "intrinsic" economic values

However, hashtime does not have a single block chain and is not a coin, unless
the concept of coin is stretched so much that almost anything is a coin.

The economics of both hashtime and crypto coins is discussed in LINK.

## The blocks

The hashtime system consists of blocks. The blocks are as general as possible
and very few decisions or assumptions are hard coded into the block format.

The purpose of a block is to prove hash work, to reference previous blocks, 
and to reference events, and possibly to refer to the initial "owner" of the
block.

A block is built of these pieces:





A block consists 

The
purpose of a block is to prove that work has been performed on behalf of a
number of older blocks and new events. Similar to bitcoin, the work is a
computation of a hash function over the content of the block including a nonce.
The work is proven by including a hash value in the block and the amount of
work is given by the difficulty of the hash, e.g. the number of leading zeros
in the hash value.
